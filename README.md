# Rhythm Guitar

### work in progress

Experimental - notate basic chord shapes that would be played at the first position on a rhythm guitar.  These are represented as patterns of MIDI notes that are suitable for use with a suitable [soundfonts](https://github.com/newlandsvalley/purescript-soundfonts) player.

The idea is eventually to provide a version of [abc-melody](https://github.com/newlandsvalley/purescript-abc-melody) that supports a player which plays the tune on channel 0 and the guitar accompaniment on channel 1 and that doesn't sound absolutely terrible!
